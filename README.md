A virtual reminder system that uses a web application to update tasks into the firebase database and a python script on the user device(raspberry pi 4) in our case. 
The script runs all the time to check for any tasks and send out a voice based reminder to the patient or the caregiver at the assigned time and expects an acknowledgement 
in the form of a button input from the patient.
An object recognition system which is another feature of the device that has a mounted camera to help recognise objects of the surroundings developed using opencv and caffemodel.
